This is starter code for your own Relative Risk calculator! To start the program, run these commands in your terminal:
```
javac RelativeRisk.java
java RelativeRisk
```

### RelativeRiskPValue.java
This program calculates how statistically significant your results are. To start the program, run these commands in your terminal:
